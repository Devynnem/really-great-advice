# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
We built a motivational poster generator application. It is created to inspire and embolden users when they feel down. Our application solves the problem of despair by generating funny and/or uplifting messages along with images. Users can save their favorite posters and create their very own!

### Context:
As we are only two weeks into the first module of Turings' software design program, this project took us approximately 16 hours spread over 5 days to complete. We also did about 6 hours of personal research and practice.

### Learning Goals:
The learning goals of this project were to learn to write easily readable JavaScript, learning how to manipulate HTML and CSS using the DOM, build understanding of writing code collaboratively, and performing GitHub workflow effectively. We also used VSCode, Tuple, Zoom, and the built in dev tools.


### Wins + Challenges:
Wins: 

1. Got more comfortable with pseudocoding

2. Got hands on experience doing real time bug fixes

3. Got better at using the DOM

Challenges: 

1. Navigating each others' schedule and time zone differences. We solved this by compromising and communicating frequently about our needs.


2. Figuring out syntaxes for new languages. We reached out to the resources available to us, including our personal mentors, our rock, and our cohort.
