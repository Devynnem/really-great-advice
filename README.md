# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
We built a motivational poster generater application. It is created to inspire and embolden users when the feel down. Our application solves that problem by generating funny and/or uplifting messages and images. Users can save their favorite posters and create their very own!

### Learning Goals:
The learning goals of this project were to learn to write easily readable JavaScript, learning how to manipulate HTML and CSS using the Dom, build understanding of writing code collaboratively, and performing GitHub workflow effectively. We also used VSCode, tuple, Zoom, and the built in dev tools.


### Wins + Challenges:
Wins: Got more comfortable with pseudocoding, doing real time bug fixes, getting better at using the DOM
Challenges: Navigating each others' schedule and time zone differences, figuring syntaxes for new languages.

We reached out to the resources available to us, our personal mentors, our rock, and our cohort.
